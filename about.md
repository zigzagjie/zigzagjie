## 欢迎来到我的个人博客小站

I am Jie Lou, a graudate student studying information systems at Carnegie Mellon University. This is my personal website to show some hands-on projects on data science. You can reach me via [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jielou/). I am more than happy to discuss with you.

The website was created on Feb. 6th, 2018. It is not too late. I am really new to html and markdown file to edit web pages. However, I believe I will add more content in the coming future.
